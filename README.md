Linear Regression from Scratch

This is an algorithm from scratch series for my machine learning models. 

The regression model can be used for n number of features but the visualization will work only if there is 1 number of feature.

Since, the  dataset is custom made using sklearn's datasets , so we donot need to have another dataset file or donot need to download it from anywhere. So, The code wil run simply by cloning and running the main.py file.

Reinventing the wheel is fun.
